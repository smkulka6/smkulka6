The system continuously monitors key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall to determine the optimal times for irrigation. Based on real-time data, it automatically activates or deactivates the pump to ensure efficient water usage and optimal crop growth.</p> <p>This project not only aims to enhance agricultural productivity but also serves an educational purpose. By working on this system, students will gain hands-on experience in sensor integration, real-time data processing, and automated control systems. Moreover, they will learn how weather conditions directly affect agricultural practices, highlighting the importance of adaptive technology in sustainable farming.</p>"},{"location":"BillofMaterials/","title":"Bill Of Materials","text":"Part Name/Description Unit Quantity Unit Prototype Cost Total Prototype Cost Unit Production Cost Total Production Cost Manufacturer Manufacturer Part # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Supplier Supplier Part # # Ordered Date Submitted to Prof. # Received Surplus Schematic Reference Designators Fuse 1.5A 1 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Littlefuse 02981001ZXT Digikey Datasheet Digikey F3470-ND 0 2/28/2025 -1 F1 Capacitor 10 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Peralta Lab Capacitor Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab 0 2/28/2025 -10 C, C2, C4, C? 61301411021 3 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Peralta Lab 61301411021 Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab 0 2/28/2025 -3 Connector IN, Connector OUT, Snap Programmer Inductor 1 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Peralta Lab Inductor Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab 0 2/28/2025 -1 L Light-Emitting Diode 3 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Peralta Lab LED Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab 0 2/28/2025 -3 LED- PIC Debug, LED- Power Debug DC Motor 1 $8.10 $8.10 $0.00 $0.00 DFrobot 1738-1315-ND Digikey Datasheet Digikey 3 2/28/2025 -1 Motor Pump Resistor 5 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Peralta Lab Resistor Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab Peralta Lab 0 2/28/2025 -5 R1, R6, R7, R?
