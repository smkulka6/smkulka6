## About Me

My name is Siddhant Kulkarni, and this is actually a course project work for my Spring 2025 Innovation showcase at Arizona State University, wherein we are going to design and develop an interactive web-enabled device that encourages K-12 children to participate in STEM fields. I have a background in robotics and embedded systems and will use that knowledge to create a truly engaging and learning experience that inspires curiosity and innovation among younger minds.

## Project Overview

We are developing an intelligent agricultural system that leverages weather data and sensor inputs to control a motorized pump. The system continuously monitors key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall to determine the optimal times for irrigation. Based on real-time data, it automatically activates or deactivates the pump to ensure efficient water usage and optimal crop growth.

This project not only aims to enhance agricultural productivity but also serves an educational purpose. By working on this system, students will gain hands-on experience in sensor integration, real-time data processing, and automated control systems. Moreover, they will learn how weather conditions directly affect agricultural practices, highlighting the importance of adaptive technology in sustainable farming.
